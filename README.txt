Important setup steps (Form submissions):
----------------------------------------
1) This template uses Formspree for contact/appointment submissions.
   - Create a Formspree form at https://formspree.io/ and follow their steps to get a form endpoint like:
     https://formspree.io/f/abcxyz123
   - Replace 'https://formspree.io/f/yourFormID' in contact.html with your actual Formspree endpoint.
   - Verify the email (Formspree will send a verification to your email). Once verified, submissions will be forwarded to your email.

2) Uploading to GitHub Pages:
   - Unzip this package, then open your GitHub repo.
   - Add files (Upload files) or push via git from your computer.
   - In GitHub repo -> Settings -> Pages: set source = main branch / root and save.
   - Your site will be available at: https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/

3) WhatsApp button:
   - The site includes a floating WhatsApp button linking to: https://wa.me/917861020303
   - To change the number, search for '917861020303' in files and replace with new number in international format (without +).

4) Thank-you page:
   - After form submission (demo behaviour), user is redirected to thank-you.html.
   - When using Formspree endpoint, the form will submit to Formspree and the service will handle post-submission behaviour.

5) Customize content:
   - Update contact details, address, email in contact.html as needed.
   - Update meta tags in the <head> of each page for better SEO.
