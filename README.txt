Aadhaar Sewa Kendra - Upload-ready site
--------------------------------------

What's included:
- index.html, contact.html, appointment.html, thank-you.html
- css/styles.css
- images/og-image.jpg (generated placeholder preview image)
- images/favicon.ico

Notes / Next steps:
1) I created a generated placeholder 'logo' inside og-image.jpg to hint the Aadhaar icon.
   Replace images/og-image.jpg with the official social preview image if you prefer the real Aadhaar logo.
2) To include the official Aadhaar logo, add your logo file as images/aadhaar-logo.png and update pages accordingly.
3) The forms are simple and redirect to thank-you.html. For real backend processing, connect to a server or use a form service.
4) Upload the entire contents of this ZIP to your GitHub Pages repository root or keep inside AADHAAR-SEWA-KENDRA/ folder.
